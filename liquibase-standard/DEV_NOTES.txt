Pre-3.1 Development Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

API changes:
- liquibase.Context
Introduced new liquibase.Contexts class in favor of the mix of Strings, List<String>, Set<String> String... and other types of variables that was used before.
Kept existing interfaces for the most part for backwards compatibility, but need to mark them all as deprecated.

 - liquibase.DbmsSet
 TODO: Need to do somethign like liquibase.Context but for dbms usage
 
Features:
- liquibase.parser.core.formattedsql.FormattedSqlChangeLogParser
Added support for multiple DBMS values in formatted SQL changelogs. Use comma separated values without spaces, e.g. "dbms:oracle,h2".

Added system property "liquibase.env" to support multiple instances running on a single host, keeping a separation of instances by including an environment 
name. The LOCKEDBY column when the system property is set will include the liquibase.env value, separated by a #. e.g. localhost#server1 (127.0.0.1)
