We encourage security researchers and users to share the details of any suspected vulnerabilities with the Liquibase Information Security Team by submitting the relevant information. Liquibase will review the submission to determine if the finding is valid and has not been previously reported. We require submitters to include detailed information with steps for us to reproduce the vulnerability.
