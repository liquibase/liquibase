 LiquiBase 1.4.0 has been released. Major features include:

- IntelliJ Plug-in Support

- MaxDB/SAPDB Support
- Refactored Code
- Can specify data types as java.sql.Types.*
- Support for composite foreign keys

Upgrading is simply a matter of replacing the liquibase.jar file. To take advantage of newer change log features, change your XSD declaration to:

<databasechangelog xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/1.4";
xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance";
schemalocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/1.4
http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-1.4.xsd";>

Version 1.4.1.0 of the LiquiBase IntelliJ plug-in is now available in the plug-in manager.

This release is primarily a bug fix release.

The core LiquiBase library is a database refactoring and change management tool.  The IntelliJ plug-in builds on the base library to make database refactoring as easy as code refactoring.
