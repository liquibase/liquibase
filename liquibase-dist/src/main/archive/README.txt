Liquibase Community ${project.version}

Introduction
--------------------------------------------
Thanks for installing Liquibase Community ${project.version}.

The Liquibase Community product ships without extensions, drivers, and many other packages and dependencies. This change provides a much lighter, modular, and customizable Liquibase experience for Community users. Importantly, this flexibility both allows and requires users to manage their Liquibase dependencies for their specific needs.

Using Liquibase Package Manager (LPM) 
--------------------------------------------
Liquibase Package Manager is now integrated and available for use directly from within the Community CLI experience with a new `liquibase lpm` command as the preferred method for managing dependencies. Check out the LPM README at https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-package-manager for more information. Or run `liquibase lpm --help` within Liquibase Community 5.0+.
