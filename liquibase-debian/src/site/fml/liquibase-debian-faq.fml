    <faq id="bash-auto-complete">
      <question>
        Can liquibase commands be autocompleted from bash ?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Yes, a basic auto-complete bash ahs been created to make shell interactions
            with liquibase much nicer. Still some efforts have to be made
            to make code completion smater : <b>for now available options are listed without taking care
            of the options that have already provided : you must master the options you put in your
            command line, but bash completes them for you, so you don't have
            to copy/paste them.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Bash auto-completion has to be enhanced, it's a good start,
            shell gurus and liquibase lovers are welcome to make it even better.</p>
