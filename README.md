Liquibase helps millions of developers track, version, and deploy database schema changes. It will help you to:
- Control database schema changes for specific versions
- Eliminate errors and delays when releasing databases
- Automatically order scripts for deployment
- Easily rollback changes
- Collaborate with tools you already use

This repository contains the main source code for Liquibase Open Source. For more information about the product, see the [Liquibase website](https://www.liquibase.com/).

## Liquibase Automation and Integrations

Liquibase can be integrated with Maven, Ant, Gradle, Spring Boot, and other CI/CD tools. For a full list, see [Liquibase Tools & Integrations](https://docs.liquibase.com/tools-integrations/home.html). You can use Liquibase with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-github-action-example), [Spinnaker](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-spinnaker-plugin), and many different [workflows](https://docs.liquibase.com/workflows/home.html).

## Publish Release Manual Trigger to Sonatype 

1. When a PO (Product Owner) or a Team Leader navigates to Publish a release from here -> https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/new, the workflow from /workflow/release-published.yml job is triggered. 
2. When a release is triggered, the workflow file will stop after `Setup` step and an email will be sent out to the list of `approvers` mentioned in job `manual_trigger_deployment`. You can click on the link and perform anyone of the options mentioned in description. 
3. A minimum of 2 approvers are needed in order for the other jobs such as `deploy_maven`, `deploy_javadocs`, `publish_to_github_packages`, etc to be executed.
4. When you view the GitHub PR, make sure to verify the version which is being published. It should say something like `Deploying v4.20.0 to sonatype`
