To update Homebrew with the latest Liquibase installtion tar file do the following:
1. From a Linux/Mac machine, visit the following page https://download.liquibase.org/download/?frm=n
2.Download the tar.gz from the link provided on that page.
For example: Linux/Unix/Mac: Download liquibase-<current liquibase version>-bin.tar.gz
3. Then run SHA256 Checksum on that file.  For example: shasum -a 256 /path/to/file/Download liquibase-<current liquibase version>-bin.tar.gz
You should see a hash key printed on the Console output.
4. Go to Homebrew/liquibase page.  For example: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/liquibase
5. Click on the "Formula code on GitHub" link
6. This should bring you to the Homebrew-core/Formula/liquibase.rb file, located in the "Homebrew-core" repository
From the Github Web UI 
7. Edit the liquibase.rb by updating the line where url is to the actual/current url from Liquibase download site mentioned in step 2.
8. Edit the liquibase.rb by updating the line where sha256 with the SHA256 Checksum key generated in step 3.
9. Hit the "Propose file change" - This will write it to a new branch in your fork <your username>/homebrew-core, so you can send a pull request.
Note (OPTIONAL): There is a way to use the "brew bump-formula-pr" command, it should help to update url and hash at once (this hasn't been tested yet).
