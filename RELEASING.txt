 Liquibase 1.4.0 has been released. Major features include:

- IntelliJ Plug-in Support
- Added support for specifying schemas in change log
- MaxDB/SAPDB Support
- Refactored Code
- Can specify data types as java.sql.Types.*
- Support for composite foreign keys
- Improved Maven support
- Bug Fixes

Upgrading is simply a matter of replacing the liquibase.jar file. To take advantage of newer change log features, change your XSD declaration to:

<databasechangelog xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/1.4";
xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance";
schemalocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/1.4
