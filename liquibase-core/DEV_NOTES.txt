Pre-3.1 Development Notes

API changes:
- liquibase.Context
Introduced new liquibase.Contexts class in favor of the mix of Strings, List<String>, Set<String> String... and other types of variables that was used before.
Kept existing interfaces for the most part for backwards compatibility, but need to mark them all as deprecated.

 - liquibase.DbmsSet
 TODO: Need to do somethign like liquibase.Context but for dbms usage
