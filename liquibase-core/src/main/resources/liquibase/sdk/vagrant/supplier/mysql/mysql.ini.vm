## MySQL Server Instance Configuration File Template
## ----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Version 1.0.2
##
## Lines that starts like this are comments and wont be put in the output.
## Normal comments are output.
##
## Replaceable things must be like:
##
## <<{:=1+1}>>
##
## You can put more than one optional expression one after another.
## The option to be picked is the one that contains the correct
## config option tag before the : You can specify multiple optional
## tags by separating them with a |  Example:
##
## <<{:=1+1}{:BLA|BLE=1+[one]}>>
##
## An empty tag is the default value.
##
## All expressions are evaluated as doubles, but rounded to integers.
##
## If you don't put a = after the :, the remaining expression will be
## interpreted as a string and variables will be simply replaced.
##
## If an expression is enclosed with <<< >>> (instead of << >>), the
## line will not be written to the output file. You can use that for
## temporary variables.
##
## You can put the following flags between : and = for arithmetical
## expressions:
##  R - round to nearest multiple of 1000
##  K - round to nearest multiple of 1K or 1M or 1G
##  M - take max value, from list separated by commas
##  m - same for min
##  N - allow negative result.
##
## pick appropriate values for these

# MySQL Server Instance Configuration File
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Generated by the MySQL Server Instance Configuration Wizard
#
#
# Installation Instructions
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# On Linux you can copy this file to /etc/my.cnf to set global options,
# mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to set server-specific options
# (@localstatedir@ for this installation) or to
# ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options.
#
# On Windows you should keep this file in the installation directory
# of your server (e.g. C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y). To
# make sure the server reads the config file use the startup option
# "--defaults-file".
#
# To run run the server from the command line, execute this in a
# command line shell, e.g.
# mysqld --defaults-file="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini"
#
# To install the server as a Windows service manually, execute this in a
# command line shell, e.g.
# mysqld --install MySQLXY --defaults-file="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server X.Y\my.ini"
#
# And then execute this in a command line shell to start the server, e.g.
# net start MySQLXY
#
#
# Guildlines for editing this file
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# In this file, you can use all long options that the program supports.
# If you want to know the options a program supports, start the program
# with the "--help" option.
#
# More detailed information about the individual options can also be
# found in the manual.
#
#
# CLIENT SECTION
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The following options will be read by MySQL client applications.
# Note that only client applications shipped by MySQL are guaranteed
# to read this section. If you want your own MySQL client program to
# honor these values, you need to specify it as an option during the
# MySQL client library initialization.

# If set to 1, InnoDB will flush (fsync) the transaction logs to the

# logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written to the log file and
# the log file flushed to disk approximately once per second. Value 2
# means the log is written to the log file at each commit, but the log
# file is only flushed to disk approximately once per second.

# access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this
# parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
# too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may
# cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you

# set it too high.

# Size of each log file in a log group. You should set the combined size
