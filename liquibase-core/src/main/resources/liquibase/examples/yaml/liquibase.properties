##      The liquibase.properties file stores properties which do not change often,
##      such as database connection information. Properties stored here save time
##      and reduce risk of mistyped command line arguments.

##   Note about relative and absolute paths:
##      The liquibase.properties file requires paths for some properties.
##      The classpath is the path/to/resources (ex. src/main/resources).
##      The changeLogFile path is relative to the classpath.
##      The url H2 example below is relative to 'pwd' resource.
####
# Enter the path for your changelog file.
changeLogFile=example-changelog.yaml

#### Enter the Target database 'url' information  ####
liquibase.command.url=jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9090/mem:dev

# Enter the username for your Target database.
liquibase.command.username: dbuser

# Enter the password for your Target database.
liquibase.command.password: letmein

#### Enter the Source Database 'referenceUrl' information ####
## The source database is the baseline or reference against which your target database is compared for diff/diffchangelog commands.

# Enter URL for the source database
liquibase.command.referenceUrl: jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9090/mem:integration

# Enter the username for your source database
liquibase.command.referenceUsername: dbuser

# Enter the password for your source database
liquibase.command.referencePassword: letmein

# Logging Configuration
# logLevel controls the amount of logging information generated. If not set, the default logLevel is INFO.
# Valid values, from least amount of logging to most, are:
#   OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, ALL
# If you are having problems, setting the logLevel to DEBUG and re-running the command can be helpful.
# logLevel: DEBUG

# The logFile property controls where logging messages are sent. If this is not set, then logging messages are
# displayed on the console. If this is set, then messages will be sent to a file with the given name.
# logFile: liquibase.log
