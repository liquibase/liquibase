/**
 * A Statement implementation is a high-level description of a command to execute.
 * Statements are the major abstraction that allows Liquibase to perform operations in a cross-database and cross-environment manner.
 * <p></p>
 * The Statement class does not know how to execute the command, it simply describes what is wanted.
 * For example, an AddColumnStatement would contain all the information needed to add a column (the table name, the new column name, the column data type, etc.) but does not contain any
 * information on the SQL to execute. To actually execute a Statement, it is converted to {@link liquibase.action.Action}s by {@link liquibase.statementlogic.StatementLogicFactory}
 * and the generated Actions can be executed.
 * <p></p>
 * Statements should correspond to relatively simple. More complex operations should be handled by a {@link liquibase.change.Change} which can compose multiple Statements together.
 * Often times a Statement corresponds to a single SQL statement, but they can be any high level/abstract representation of a command.
 * <p></p>
 * For consistency:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Statements should have a no-arg constructor in addition to any convenience constructors that take normally required values.</li>
 * <li>Any "set" style methods should return "this" to allow builder-style syntax.</li>
 * <li>Names of attributes should be exposed as public static final Strings. </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see liquibase.statement.AbstractStatement for easier implementations
